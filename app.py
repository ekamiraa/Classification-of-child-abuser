        Cases of child abuse in Indonesia continue to increase each year and have become a serious concern. The impact of abuse is not only 
        physical but also affects the child's psychological and social development. Many of these acts are committed by people close to the 
        child, such as family members, caregivers, teachers, or friends. Identifying the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator 
        is essential to understanding the patterns and causes of abuse, so that better prevention efforts can be made. Online news platforms 
        often report child abuse incidents and can be used as a valuable data source. However, manually identifying perpetrators from these 
        news articles is difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, this study uses text classification with a neural network approach to 
        automatically detect the type of perpetrator based on the news content. This method is expected to help authorities and child protection 
        institutions respond more quickly and effectively to abuse cases.

        training time (in seconds). The best model in this phase, Model Z3 (node = 60, learning rate = 0.01), showed the most efficient learning process with the fastest convergence 
        and lowest final cost. In the testing phase, model performance was measured using standard classification metrics‚Äîaccuracy, precision, recall,

        unseen data. Lastly, in the k-fold cross-validation phase, the focus was on the model‚Äôs stability and consistency, measured by the average 
        accuracy across all folds. Model Z2 (node = 60, learning rate = 0.005) achieved the highest average accuracy of 82,90%, demonstrating robust performance across different
